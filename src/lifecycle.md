## Broker lifecycle

This section describes what happens when the `ServiceBroker` starts or stops.

### Starting logic

When the broker starts
[Transporter](transporters.html)
to connect to other nodes,
does not yet publish the local service list.
It starts all the `Services` first (calls the "started" handler)
and then publishes the service list to the other nodes.
Hence remote nodes send requests only after all local service are started properly.

::: warning Circular references
Dead-locks can be made when two services wait for each other.
For example "users" service has a dependency to "posts" service and "posts" has a dependency to "users".
Three or more services can cause deadlock at startup when referenced to each other circularly.
Circular references cannot be automatically blocked by `ServiceBroker`, so the startup sequence must be well planned.
:::

### Stopping logic

When you call "broker.stop()" the `Service` Broker sends a "DISCONNECT" message to remote nodes,
so they can route the requests to other instances instead of services under stopping.
Then the `ServiceBroker` stops all local services and the `Transporter`.

## Service lifecycle

This section describes what happens when a service is starting & stopping and how you should use the lifecycle event handler.

### "started" event handler

It is triggered when the broker.start is called and the broker starts all local services.
Use it to connect to database, listen servers...etc.

```java{17}
import services.moleculer.ServiceBroker;
import services.moleculer.cacher.Cacher;
import services.moleculer.service.*;

@Name("test")
public class TestService extends Service {

    /**
     * Object to initialize
     */
    private Cacher cacher;

    /**
     * Starting the Service instance...
     */
    @Override
    public void started(ServiceBroker broker) throws Exception {
        super.started(broker);

        // Custom initialization code
        cacher = broker.getConfig().getCacher();
        // ...
    }
}
```

To register for the above `Service` at the `Service` Broker:

```java
ServiceBrokerConfig cfg = new ServiceBrokerConfig();
cfg.setNodeID("node1");
ServiceBroker broker = ServiceBroker(cfg);
broker.createService(new TestService());
broker.start();
```

### "stopped" event handler

It is triggered when the broker.stop is called and the broker starts stopping all local services.
Use it to close database connections, stop `Executors` and `Timers`, close sockets...etc.

```java{7}
import services.moleculer.service.*;

@Name("test")
public class TestService extends Service {

    @Override
    public void stopped() {
        super.stopped();
        
        // Release resources...
    }
}
```

If you use Spring, the above "started" and "stopped" functions should not be called by Spring as init-method or destroy-method).
These functions are invoked in all cases by the `ServiceBroker`, not by the Spring Framework.
However, you can create "init" / "destroy" functions for Spring, regardless of the "started" / "stopped" functions.
In this case, the start and stop order is as follows:

```java
import javax.annotation.*;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import io.datatree.Tree;
import services.moleculer.ServiceBroker;
import services.moleculer.service.*;

@Name("test")
@Controller
public class TestService extends Service {

    // --- STARTING SERVICE ---
    
    public TestService() {

        // 1.) The constructor is called first
    }

    @Override
    public void started(ServiceBroker broker) throws Exception {
        super.started(broker);

        // 2.) Initialize service - all local Services are
        // registered but only some of them have been started

        // Registered Services are accessible as follows:
        // xyzService = (XyzService) broker.getLocalService("xyz");
    }

    // --- RUNNING SERVICE ---
    
    public Action action = ctx -> {

        // 3.) This Action is called by other Actions
        // Request: { "foo": 5 }
        int foo = ctx.params.get("foo", 0)

        // Response: { "result": 8 }
        return new Tree().put("result", foo + 3);
    };

    // --- STOPPING SERVICE ---

    @Override
    public void stopped() {

        // 4.) Invoked by the Service Broker before the shutdown
    }

    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {

        // 5.) This called last by the Garbage Collector
    }
}
```
