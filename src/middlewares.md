## About Middlewares

`Middleware` functions are functions that have access to the request `Context` ("ctx"),
the configuration of the `Action` ("config"),
and the next `Action` (or `Middleware`) function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle ("action"):
The "config" contains all annotations of the `Action`,
[converted](actions.html#converting-java-annotations-to-platform-independent-properties)
to a [Tree](https://berkesa.github.io/datatree/) (~= JSON) object.
`Middleware` functions can perform the following tasks:

- Execute any code.
- Make changes to the request and the response objects.
- End the request-response cycle.
- Call the next **local or remote** `Action` or `Middleware` in the stack.

```java
public class MyMiddleware extends Middleware {

    public Action install(Action action, Tree config) {

        // Create new "Action" or return "null", this is decided by
        // the "config" which contains the parameters of the original Action.
        // If you return "null", you won't install Middleware for the Action.

        return new Action() {
            public Object handler(Context ctx) throws Exception {

                // --- FUNCTIONS BEFORE CALLING THE ACTION ---

                // Do nothig, just invoke next Middleware or Action
                Object rsp = action.handler(ctx);

                // --- FUNCTIONS AFTER CALLING THE ACTION ---

                // Return the response of the Action
                return rsp;
            }
        };
    }
}
```

Use the "use" function of `ServiceBroker` to install the `Middleware`:

```java
broker.use(new MyMiddleware());
```

`Middlewares` is executed in **reverse order** as they are added to `ServiceBroker`:

```java
broker.use(new LastMiddleware()); // Installed and/or executed LAST
broker.use(new ThirdMiddleware());
broker.use(new SecondMiddleware());
broker.use(new FirstMiddleware()); // Installed and/or executed FIRST
```

## Example of Middleware-based pre-processing

In Java-based Moleculer, it is easiest to configure `Actions` with annotations.
The following code snippet creates an annotation to assign Roles to `Actions`:

```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target({ ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.TYPE })
public @interface RequiredRoles {

    String[] value() default { "admin" };

}
```

Annotations can be added to the `Actions` as follows:

```java{3,8}
public class CheckedService extends Service {

    @RequiredRoles("admin")
    public Action adminAction = ctx -> {
        // ...
    };

    @RequiredRoles({"user", "admin"})
    public Action userAction = ctx -> {
        // ...
    };

}
```

`Middleware` can access the list of "RequiredRoles" via the "config" object:

```java
public class AccessControllerMiddleware extends Middleware {

    @Override
    public Action install(Action action, Tree config) {

        // Does the Action have "RequiredRoles" annotation?
        Tree requiredRoles = config.get("requiredRoles");
        if (requiredRoles == null) {

            // If there is no "RequiredRoles", we won't install anything
            return null;
        }

        // Install new "layer" on top of the Action
        return new Action() {

            @Override
            public Object handler(Context ctx) throws Exception {

                // Role check with some control function
                if (!userInRole(ctx, requiredRoles)) {
                    throw new SecurityException("Access denied!");
                }

                // Access is allowed
                return action.handler(ctx);
            }
        };
    }

}
```

Finally install the `Middleware` using the "use" function of `ServiceBroker`:

```java
broker.use(new AccessControllerMiddleware());
```

## Caching the response of Actions

Among many other uses, `Middleware` is used to cache the response of `Action`.
[Cacher](https://github.com/moleculer-java/moleculer-java/blob/master/src/main/java/services/moleculer/cacher/Cacher.java)
`Middleware` is an abstract class that uses request input data as a key to store responses in a cache.
The actual implementation of the `Cacher` can be local or distributed.
`Cacher` `Middleware` is automatically added to `ServiceBroker` at startup.

There is another kind of middleware in the Moleculer Framework; the `HttpMiddleware`.
An HTTP Middleware is similar to Middleware, but HTTP Middleware processes HTTP requests instead of internal `Action` calls.
